.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is program which uses User Datagram Protocol to determine if computer is able to send
and/or receive IP Unicast and Multicast packets from the network. It's designed to be used in very
similar way as
.Xr ping 8
and also has some features of the
.Xr fping 8
command.
Where
.Xr ping 8
and
.Nm
differ is in who replies. In
.Xr ping 8
replies are sent by the operating system and with
.Nm
another instance of
.Nm
sends the reply. This mean that
.Nm
must be running on all computers to test sending/receiving IP Multicast.
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Force usage of IPv4.
.It Fl 6
Force usage of IPv6.
.It Fl C
Display continuous statistics for every reply message.
.It Fl D
Disable packet duplicate detection. Option is default for interval 0.
.It Fl F
Allow entering of arguments which are not allowed or not recommended by the specification. This is
typically the interval parameter. This option may be used multiple times.
.It Fl q
Quiet output. Nothing is displayed except state changes and summary. Option can be used twice and
then only summary is displayed.
.It Fl V
Display version and quit.
.It Fl v
Set level of verbosity. Parameter can be used multiple times to achieve higher verbosity.
.It Fl M Ar transport_method
Set transport method to use. This can be
.Cm asm
for Any-source Multicast and
.Cm ssm
for Source-specific Multicast.
.It Fl i Ar interval
Wait
.Ar interval
seconds between sending each request packet. The default is to wait for one
second between each packet.
.It Fl m Ar mcast_addr
Multicast address to listen on for multicast answer messages. Default is 232.43.211.234 for IPv4
and ff3e::4321:1234 for IPv6.
.It Fl p Ar port
Port to bind and listen on for both unicast and multicast messages. Default is 4321.
.It Fl r Ar rate_limit
Rate limit interval between two query messages to
.Ar rate_limit
seconds. Default value is same as
.Ar interval
given by
.Fl i
option. Rate limiting can be disabled by specifying 0 as value. Rate limiting is by default disabled
for
.Fl i
with 0 seconds.
.It Fl T Ar timeout
Specify a timeout, in seconds, before
.Nm
exits regardless of how many packets have
been received.
.It Fl t Ar ttl
Time-To-Live of sent packets.
.It Fl w Ar wait_time
after
.Nm
is stopped (by sending SIGINT or timeout expire) it is moved to special state when no queries are
made and server answer all queries by server response (stop message). This makes possible to give
correct (unbiased) result of lost packets on other nodes. Default is 3 times interval. Also
special value 0 can be used to not wait at all or -1 which means wait forever (this can be still
terminated by sending SIGINT).
.It Ar remote_addr
List of addresses to test. One of them must be address of local internet interface. This
local address is used for bind and listening on for unicast packets. It's also used to determine
which interface should be used for sending multicast replies.
.El
.Pp
Program is normally terminated by SIGINT. After signal receive summary is displayed. You can also
display summary during running by sending SIGINFO or SIGUSR1 signal.
.Pp
When using
.Nm
for fault isolation, it should first be run against local internet
interface only, to verify that the local network interface is up and running, and firewall
is correctly configured. This mode is available by entering only local IP address.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following commands and output is a typical way how to find-out and solve network problems
using omping. In this situation, we have 3 computers named node-01, node-02 and node-03 with IP addresses
192.168.1.101 - 192.168.1.103. Let's run the following command on all of them.
.Pp
.Dl $ omping node-01 node-02 node-03
.Pp
on all of nodes we should be able to seen similar output
.Pp
.Dl node-01 : waiting for response msg
.Dl node-03 : waiting for response msg
.Dl node-01 : joined (S,G) = (*, 232.43.211.234), pinging
.Dl node-03 : joined (S,G) = (*, 232.43.211.234), pinging
.Dl node-01 :   unicast, seq=1, size=69 bytes, dist=0, time=0.192ms
.Dl node-01 : multicast, seq=1, size=69 bytes, dist=0, time=0.284ms
.Dl node-03 :   unicast, seq=1, size=69 bytes, dist=0, time=0.279ms
.Dl node-03 : multicast, seq=1, size=69 bytes, dist=0, time=0.360ms
.Pp
The first two lines tell us, that node-02 (actual node) is waiting for a response
message from node-01 and node-03. The second two lines contain information, that
we were successfully able to send an init message and also received a response
message from remote nodes. Both of these messages are unicast, so we are able to
send and receive unicast messages on a given port. If all of nodes are up and
.Nm
is running on all of them, but we are not able to receive a response
message, it's time to check connectivity between nodes. First make sure that
you are able to
.Xr ping 8
them. If so, make sure that your firewall allows port 4321 to receive udp packets.
.Pp
The next line tells us that we were able to receive a 69 byte unicast response message from
node-01, with a sequence number of 1. The distance between the computers is 0 so they are on
the same link net. Time between send and receive packet was 0.192 ms, that is also the
current average time and lastly there were no lost packets.
.Pp
The 6th line tells us the same information as the previous one, but the received message
is a multicast message. It means, that multicast is probably well configured.
.Pp
The 7th and 8th lines are same as previous two one but for node-03.
.Pp
If the node is able to receive unicast packets, but never multicast, it means that multicast
configuration is incorrect. It's recommended to turn off your firewall. If multicast packets start to
arrive, great. If not, the problem is hidden in the switches/routers between the nodes. Contact your
system administrator to allow multicast traffic on the switch or router.
.Pp
.Nm
is terminated by SIGINT signal (CTRL-c). Summary statistics are shown
.Pp
.Dl node-01 :   unicast, xmt/rcv/%loss = 389/389/0%, min/avg/max = 0.267/0.289/0.386
.Dl node-01 : multicast, xmt/rcv/%loss = 389/389/0%, min/avg/max = 0.306/0.332/0.540
.Dl node-03 :   unicast, xmt/rcv/%loss = 289/289/0%, min/avg/max = 0.262/0.284/0.365
.Dl node-03 : multicast, xmt/rcv/%loss = 289/289/0%, min/avg/max = 0.325/0.356/0.548

.Sh STANDARDS
.Nm
uses Internet-Draft draft-ietf-mboned-ssmping-08 as underlaying protocol and tries
to be as compliant as possible.

.Sh BUGS
.Bl -dash
.It
Actually computed RTT is not RTT taken from packet, but end-to-end delivery.

It's impossible to set size of send/receive buffer.
.It
No count mode.
